Line Fitter
***********

This module is the work horse for fitting spectral lines from an input catalog to a given 1D spectrum. The line fitting itself is performed using the module `pyspeckit`_.

`pyspeckit`_ uses an iterative method to fit the spectral lines and the continuum simultaneously. :mod:`line_fitter` automatically adjusts the input parameters to `pyspeckit`_ in the manner to optimize the fitting (*continuum order* and *wavelegth limits*)

The :mod:`line_fitter` determines whether the fit fullfils the set parameters and was, therefore, succesfull and can be further used to do the velocity fitting. :mod:`line_fitter` also allows to fit blends by fixing a maximum ratio between the primary line (the one the user is interested in) and the secondary line (blend). This ensures that the blend does not become the dominant line.

In order to accomodate hyper-velocity stars an option is given that the wavelength limits are automatically adjust for each iteration based on the solution of the primary line.
