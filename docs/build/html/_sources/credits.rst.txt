We would like to thank B. James for her patience for being the first user of the *MUSEpack* and, especially, :class:`MUSEreduce.musereduce`, which highly improved the user-friendliness of the package and tracing errors in the code

We thank N. LÃ¼tzgendorf for helping us developing the Monte Carlo module :mod:`ppxf_MC`.
