MUSEpack - a tool to analyze IFS datasets
=========================================

Introduction
------------

MUSEpack is a python package written to support the data analyzes from Integral Field Units, specifically tailored to use datasets of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (`MUSE`_) mounted at UT4 of the VLT.

The main purpose of MUSEpack is the measurement of stellar and gas radial velocities to an accuracy of :math:`1-3\,\rm{km/s}` without the need for spectral template libraries using :class:`radial_velocities.RV_spectrum`. By using strong stellar absorption lines or gas emission lines and a high-resolution spectral line library such as the `NIST Atomic Spectra Database`_ it is possible to create template, which are fitted to the spectra using a Monte Carlo method. For a detailed description of the code we refer to `Zeidler et al. 2019`_.

This package includes the class :class:`MUSEreduce.musereduce`, which is a easy-to-use python wrapper for the `MUSE data reduction pipeline`_ provided by ESO including a modification to ``muse_create_sky`` which prevents over subtraction of emission lines when reducing data in regions with a high, variable background such as Galactic HII regions.
