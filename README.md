# MUSEpack

*MUSEpack* is a python package written to support the data analyzes from Integral Field Units, specifically tailored to use datasets of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (`MUSE`) mounted at UT4 of the VLT (`Bacon et al. 2010`).

The main purpose of *MUSEpack* is to measure stellar and gas radial velocities to an accuracy of 1-2km/s without the need of a stellar spectral template library.

For a detailed description of *MUSEpack* we refer to https://musepack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html and to `Zeidler et al. 2019, AJ, 158, 201`.
